# stark-comp

SPA Framework

Stark Comp comes to the rescue. It's a small ~ 10kb JavaScript file, with the help of which all necessary components (objects) are initialized. And each component can use five methods. Five methods for an object are very few to learn. There is actually nothing to study here, you can immediately start enjoying the flight.

Stark Comp does not try to take over the entire developer's environment and outshine all other tools. All it does is put the prepared data in the specified place of the document.
